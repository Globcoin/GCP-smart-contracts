 # GlobCoin Crypto Platform Sale Contracts

  SmartContracts for the Globcoin Token Sale.

 ## Globcoin Bug Bounty Program

 Thank you for visiting the Globcoin Bug Bounty.

 GLOBCOIN is a digital Coin that marries the best aspects of current cryptocurrencies
 with the best aspects of fiat currencies. The value of the coin (GLX) is linked to a
 basket of fiat currencies of the 15 largest world economies and 5 % Gold. Its value
 reflects the world economy including its new components and trends such as the
 booming economies of countries like China or India, while maintaining a good
 balance of the currencies of Western economies. Launched in 2013 by a team based
 in Switzerland and the UK, the product under the brand GRC “Global reserve
 Curency” has been already offered to large corporations and high net worth
 individuals.
